### Need to work on the following modules

1)ROS integration , its important to integrate ros since most of the opensource integration of robot  revolvs around ROS for interacting with the physical/simulated robot .

2)Need to work on a better soulution for the video feed (mjpegstreammer is the best we found so far .)

### Specificatiins and challengs of Autonomous navigation.

Autonomous driving in the case of a "mars rover" would primarily have to deal with three types of challenges .

-  1)Terrain navigation, this deals with avoiding obstacles , trenches etc .

-  2)Terrain assist, this deals with problems that would occur in slippery slope.We can solve the problem using two approaches 

	-  	A) Visually guided navigation system.

	-  	B) Inertially guided navigation system.

-  3)Incase of communication faliure , it should come back to the last place with better communication.
